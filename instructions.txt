Ok bois listen up, here are the instructions for how to work on this project:

1) Install an IDE, I highly recommend PyCharm, followed by VS code or visual stuio

2) Make sure you have git installed, if not, go to https://git-scm.com/downloads to download, or run: sudo apt install git on linux

3) Go through a brief git tutorial, or learn on the fly, it's your choice (https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

4) This is where things start to get new, create a virtual environment to do your development in, otherwise there will be issues. Info for this can
be found @ https://programwithus.com/learn-to-code/Pip-and-virtualenv-on-Windows/

5) In your git command line type git clone https://github.com/stefanhts/music-app.git

6) Create a new branch labeled after the issue you will focus on:
git branch <branchname>
git checkout <branchname>

7) Get to work. I've done my best to document what I've done. We can communicate in the slack and make tickets as to what should be priority, what should
change, etc. Currently I am trying to figure out fixtures so that we can have test data available that is no in the production server which is currently on
my machine. I highly recommend watching checking out https://youtube.com/telusko he has a great series on django that might help explain things. I also
encourage you to check out the django docs: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/
these are one of the best resources there is.

-Happy hacking,
Stefan
